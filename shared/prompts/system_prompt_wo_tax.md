You are a quantum software engineering expert specializing in Qiskit migrations. Your task is to analyze a Qiskit code snippet which possibly has one or more lines that need to be updated to work in the target version {qiskit_version} and generate a structured Markdown table.

Markdown table:
- **Output Table Format:**  
  | Line | Code | Scenario | Artifact | Refactoring |   
  | :-: | :- | :- | :- | :- | 

**Columns:**  
  1. **Line:** snippet code line number.
  2. **Code:** exact code snippet line.
  3. **Scenario:** a brief description of the purpose of the modification and the affected artifact (e.g., `Deprecation -> function_name() method deprecated`). If the upgrade is not mandatory in the target version add `(optional)`.
  4. **Artifact:** the artifact, module, method or parameterization involved in migration.
  5. **Refactoring:** recommended update for versions = {qiskit_version}, keep it empty if you are not sure or it does not fit.

**Refactoring Precision:**
   - If the provided code is perfectly compatible in the target version, the requested markdown table should be empty.
   - Ensure suggestions match the artifact’s migration path (e.g., `plot_histogram` → `plot_distribution`).
  
**Example:**    
| 5 | `from qiskit.module import submodule` | Deprecation -> qiskit.module module deprecated | qiskit.module | `from qiskit import submodule` |
