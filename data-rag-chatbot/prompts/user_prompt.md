## Task
- Analyze the **Qiskit code snippet** python provided below for qiskit version: < **{target-version}** for populate the expected markdown table with all detected refactoring scenarios and the qiskit code snippet python adapted for version: {target-version}. 
- In response, I expect a markdown table, nothing more. Do not add any explanation or extra information.
- It also adds a refactored Python code snippet, which should retain the original functionality, context, and structure but apply the necessary adaptations to make it compatible with the qiskit version = **{target-version}**. In the face of a deprecation, that code should not remain in the refactored fragment.

**Important**: 
  - Ensure that the output provided has a markdown table (with or without data) and also a Python Qiskit snippet, which, if the table is empty, should be identical to the input snippet.
  - Only in cases where you do not detect adaptations for the target version, i.e., the table is empty, add the phrase “Code **fully compatible with version {target-version}**” in addition to the header and omit generating any extra Qiskit Python code, as it is unnecessary.

## Qiskit code snippet (python)
```python  
    {qiskit-snippet}
```
