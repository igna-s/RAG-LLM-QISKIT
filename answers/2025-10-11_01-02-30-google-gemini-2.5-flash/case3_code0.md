| 1 | `from qiskit import qasm` | Deprecation -> The legacy OpenQASM 2 parser module previously present in qiskit.qasm has been deprecated. | a03d6cfd-4c92-4523-a77d-3542afe18906 | qiskit.qasm | `from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit` |
| 10 | `circuit1 = qasm.Qasm(data=qasm_str)` | Deprecation -> The qiskit.converters.ast_to_dag function has been deprecated and will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release. It previously was used to convert the abstract syntax tree generated by the legacy OpenQASM 2 parser (in the qiskit.qasm module which has been deprecated) and convert that directly to a DAGCircuit. | d3e0c6f3-753f-4ff7-a61d-73446a5621de | qasm.Qasm | `circuit1 = QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str(qasm_str)` |
| 11 | `program1 = circuit1.parse()` | Deprecation -> The qiskit.converters.ast_to_dag function has been deprecated and will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release. It previously was used to convert the abstract syntax tree generated by the legacy OpenQASM 2 parser (in the qiskit.qasm module which has been deprecated) and convert that directly to a DAGCircuit. | d3e0c6f3-753f-4ff7-a61d-73446a5621de | parse() | |
