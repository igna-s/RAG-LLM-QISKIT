| 1 | `from qiskit import qasm` | Deprecation -> The legacy OpenQASM 2 parser module previously present in qiskit.qasm has been deprecated. It will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release. The legacy OpenQASM 2 parser has been superseded by the qiskit.qasm2 module which provides a faster more correct parser for OpenQASM 2. | * | 2edcf1ef-edac-448b-be69-fe31c5179872 | qiskit.qasm | `from qiskit import qasm2` |
| 8 | `circuit1 = qasm.Qasm(data=qasm_str)` | Deprecation -> The legacy OpenQASM 2 parser module previously present in qiskit.qasm has been deprecated. It will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release. The legacy OpenQASM 2 parser has been superseded by the qiskit.qasm2 module which provides a faster more correct parser for OpenQASM 2. | * | 2edcf1ef-edac-448b-be69-fe31c5179872 | qasm.Qasm | `circuit1 = qasm2.loads(qasm_str)` |
| 9 | `program1 = circuit1.parse()` | Deprecation -> The qiskit.converters.ast_to_dag function has been deprecated and will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release. It previously was used to convert the abstract syntax tree generated by the legacy OpenQASM 2 parser (in the qiskit.qasm module which has been deprecated) and convert that directly to a DAGCircuit. As the legacy OpenQASM 2 parser has been deprecated this function will no longer serves a purpose after the legacy parser is removed. If you were previously using this, you can instead parse your OpenQASM 2 files into a QuantumCircuit using the QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_file() or QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str() constructor methods and then converting that QuantumCircuit into a DAGCircuit with circuit_to_dag(). | * | a1be9ccb-ff98-44ba-a1b5-57e100241a55 | circuit1.parse() | |
