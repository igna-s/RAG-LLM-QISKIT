| 1 | `from qiskit.qasm import Qasm` | Deprecation -> The legacy OpenQASM 2 parser module previously present in qiskit.qasm has been deprecated. It will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release. The legacy OpenQASM 2 parser has been superseded by the qiskit.qasm2 module which provides a faster more correct parser for OpenQASM 2. | * | 2edcf1ef-edac-448b-be69-fe31c5179872 | qiskit.qasm.Qasm | `from qiskit.qasm2 import QASM2Parser` |
| 4 | `circuit2 = Qasm(filename=qasm_file)` | Deprecation -> The legacy OpenQASM 2 parser module previously present in qiskit.qasm has been deprecated. It will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release. The legacy OpenQASM 2 parser has been superseded by the qiskit.qasm2 module which provides a faster more correct parser for OpenQASM 2. | * | 2edcf1ef-edac-448b-be69-fe31c5179872 | Qasm | `parser = QASM2Parser(filename=qasm_file)` |
| 5 | `program2 = circuit2.parse()` | Deprecation -> The legacy OpenQASM 2 parser module previously present in qiskit.qasm has been deprecated. It will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release. The legacy OpenQASM 2 parser has been superseded by the qiskit.qasm2 module which provides a faster more correct parser for OpenQASM 2. | * | 2edcf1ef-edac-448b-be69-fe31c5179872 | Qasm.parse() | `program2 = parser.parse()` |
| 6 | `qc2 = program2.get_circuit()` | Deprecation -> The qiskit.converters.ast_to_dag function has been deprecated and will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release. It previously was used to convert the abstract syntax tree generated by the legacy OpenQASM 2 parser (in the qiskit.qasm module which has been deprecated) and convert that directly to a DAGCircuit. As the legacy OpenQASM 2 parser has been deprecated this function will no longer serves a purpose after the legacy parser is removed. If you were previously using this, you can instead parse your OpenQASM 2 files into a QuantumCircuit using the QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_file() or QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str() constructor methods and then converting that QuantumCircuit into a DAGCircuit with circuit_to_dag(). | * | a1be9ccb-ff98-44ba-a1b5-57e100241a55 | program.get_circuit() | `qc2 = QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_file(qasm_file)` |
