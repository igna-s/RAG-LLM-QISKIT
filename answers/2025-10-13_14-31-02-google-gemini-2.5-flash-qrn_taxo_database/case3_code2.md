```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit_aer import AerSimulator
from qiskit.qasm import QASM2Lexer, QASM2Parser

qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
qc.h(0)
qc.cx(0, 1)
qc.measure([0, 1], [0, 1])

qasm_str = qc.qasm()

# To parse QASM string, you would typically use QASM2Parser
# and then build a circuit from it.
# This example directly uses the QuantumCircuit for execution
# as the original intent seems to be to run the circuit.
# If strict QASM parsing and manipulation is required,
# a more involved refactoring with QASM2Lexer and QASM2Parser would be needed.
# For direct execution, the original qc can be used.

simulator = AerSimulator()
job = simulator.run(qc, shots=1024)
result = job.result()
counts = result.get_counts()
print(counts)
