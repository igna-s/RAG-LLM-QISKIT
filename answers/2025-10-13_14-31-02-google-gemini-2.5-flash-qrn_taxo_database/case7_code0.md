| 2 | `from qiskit.test.mock import FakeVigo` | Deprecation -> qiskit.test module is deprecated. This module contains tooling and helpers for internal Qiskit testing, and most of its functionality had been moved or is not used in Qiskit anymore. In practice, the module was never meant to be used externally. If any of the code in the module is absolutely necessary beyond Qiskit, consider copying that code out into your own test infrastructure. | 12 | 744bd71e-bfdf-47ac-8d99-308ba8b9474a | qiskit.test | |

```python
from mylib import getJob, getCount
from qiskit_ibm_runtime.fake_provider import FakeVigo

# Note: ReferenceCircuits from qiskit.test.reference_circuits is deprecated
# and has no direct replacement in Qiskit 1.0.0.
# You would need to define your Bell circuit explicitly.
# For example:
from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
qc.h(0)
qc.cx(0, 1)
qc.measure([0,1], [0,1])

backend = FakeVigo()

job = getJob(qc, backend)
counts = getCount(job)

print("Resultados del circuito Bell:")
print(counts)
